Card matching OOP game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user has 60s to match characters on the cards. There is a timer and a counter that updates with each try. User clicks the begin screen to start the timer and background music. Different music will play at the end of game depending on whether the user beats the timer. When finished, user can click to restart the game. 


I had the most rewarding experience coding this application. It's my first game application I created and I definitely needed a lot of help and resources creating it. This was the first time I realized I can use what ever assets I want in an app. I downloaded my own fonts, and added music to it. All of its moving parts is what made this the most frustrating, and most rewarding application I've created. This helped me understand the fundementals of OOP and helped me design a really cohesive feel.
